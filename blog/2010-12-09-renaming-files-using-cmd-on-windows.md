Suppose we have lots of lots file in a directory and we need to rename of modify the extension of all the file, then renaming one by one is pain and not a good idea as well. In that case we can use <b>ren</b> or <b>rename</b> command on windows.

If we want to rename all the files in directory in one shot then we can use ren or rename command on command prompt.

<b>Example</b>:- If we want to rename all html files to jsp files of directory D:\pages\ then executes the command.

``` bash
D:\pages>ren *.html *.jsp
```
