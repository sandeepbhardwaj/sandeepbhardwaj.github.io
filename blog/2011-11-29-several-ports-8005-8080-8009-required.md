<h2>Several ports (8005, 8080, 8009) required by Tomcat 6 at localhost are already in use.</h2>  

Today ,I faced a problem while running the tomcat with in the eclipse a popup appears  
and it says:-  

``` bash
"Several ports (8005, 8080, 8009) required by Server (Tomcat 6) at localhost are already in use. The server may already be running in another process, or a system process may be using the port. To start this server you will need to stop the other process or change the port number(s)."  
``` 

so it means we have kill that process which is running on that port says (8080).A pretty simple solution isrun the below commands on commands on command prompt. 

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<b>netstat -a -o -n</b> and it will bring up a network list,search for the local address like 127.0.0.1:8080 and note the PID (eq 3624)

``` bash
C:\>netstat -a -o -n
``` 
 
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<b>taskkill /F /PID 3624</b> . Run this command to kill that process.

``` bash
C:\>taskkill /F /PID 3624
``` 

Hurry now you are able to run your server.
